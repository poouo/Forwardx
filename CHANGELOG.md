# Changelog

## [2.3.50] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed GOST multi-hop forwarding so entry rules use intermediate hops as the chain and the exit rule port as the final forwarder target.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.50. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.49] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Moved forwarding and tunnel self-test failure details out of the dialog body and into bottom-right notifications.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.49. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.48] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed tunnel latency self-tests getting stuck in `pending` when an Agent did not report back before the timeout window.
- Prevented repeated tunnel latency self-test clicks while a test is already running.
- Prevented established multi-hop tunnels from switching between GOST and ForwardX custom-encryption runtime families; delete and recreate the tunnel instead.

### Changed

- Added a confirmation dialog before bulk one-click Agent upgrades are dispatched.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.48. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.47] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Prevented regular port forwarding rules from being edited directly onto a different entry host.
- Allowed tunnel forwarding rule edits to switch to tunnels with different entry hosts by rebinding the rule to the selected tunnel entry.
- Added Agent runtime handoff and bind-owner logs to diagnose GOST/ForwardX tunnel switching on reused entry ports.
- Fixed panel one-click upgrades when the latest version is detected from `main` before a matching release tag exists.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.47 and Agent target version to 2.2.59.

## [2.3.46] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed switching a multi-hop tunnel from GOST to ForwardX so old GOST tunnel services are stopped before FXP binds the same tunnel ports.
- Fixed Agent FXP startup reporting so immediate runtime exits, such as port bind failures, are reported as failed instead of `ok=true`.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.46 and Agent target version to 2.2.58.

## [2.3.45] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added one-click batch Agent upgrade from host management.
- Added optional Agent key-log upload with per-host and aggregate viewing in the logs page.

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic tunnel latency collection for multi-hop tunnels to aggregate fresh per-hop TCPing results instead of storing only the entry-to-next-hop latency.
- Fixed forwarding rule TCPing stats for tunnel rules to store tunnel latency plus exit-to-target latency, matching the manual self-test path.
- Reset and refresh old and new multi-hop hosts when tunnel hop topology changes so existing forwarding rules resync cleanly.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.45 and Agent target version to 2.2.57.

## [2.3.44] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed GOST multi-hop forwarding rules so the entry rule chain dials the configured middle hops directly and lands on the rule-specific tunnel exit port.
- Fixed tunnel forwarding rule self-tests to report estimated full-path latency from tunnel-hop latency plus exit-to-target latency, instead of only TCPing the entry listener.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.44 and Agent target version to 2.2.56 so GitHub Release assets can be used for machine updates.

## [2.3.43] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed GOST multi-hop tunnel rules so entry chains traverse every configured hop and land on the rule-specific tunnel exit port instead of the tunnel probe port.
- Fixed tunnel forwarding rule self-tests to prefer entry-port end-to-end probing instead of estimating latency from exit-to-target checks plus tunnel hop probes.
- Limited multi-hop tunnels to a maximum of five hosts from both the UI and server validation.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.43. Agent target version remains 2.2.55.

## [2.3.42] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed ForwardX multi-hop tunnels so rule traffic enters the configured hop chain instead of bypassing relay nodes.
- Fixed FXP relay downstream encryption handshakes to use the relay segment key, restoring data forwarding through multi-hop relay chains.
- Allowed intermediate tunnel hop Agents to report tunnel runtime status.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.42 and Agent target version to 2.2.55.

## [2.3.32] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Target addresses now support domain names in addition to IP addresses. The heartbeat handler resolves domains to IPs on each cycle and automatically re-applies forwarding rules when the resolved IP changes, ensuring forwarding stays online through DNS migrations.
- Forwarding rules that use user-space proxies (realm, socat, gost) now show an amber notice in the UI that connection and IP counts are conntrack-based approximations.

### Fixed

- Fixed Go Agent connection count reporting that was storing absolute conntrack snapshot values instead of deltas, causing massively inflated connection totals in the dashboard.
- Fixed counting chain traffic undercount in the shell-based Agent by removing it entirely and requiring the Go Agent binary for all installations. The Go Agent reads all five mangle hook points and takes the maximum to avoid double-counting.
- Cleaned up stale filter-table cleanup commands in the server-side counting chain removal logic.

### Changed

- Rewrote the one-click install script as a self-contained Go Agent installer. The legacy shell-based Agent has been retired.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.32 and Agent target version to 2.2.53.

## [2.3.31] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fixed inbound and outbound traffic accounting across iptables, nftables, realm, socat, gost, and tunnel forwarding paths.
- Fixed ForwardX encrypted tunnel traffic reporting to count real forwarded payload bytes instead of relying on outer tunnel socket counters.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.31 and Agent target version to 2.2.52.

## [2.3.30] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Fixed Agent reconnect handling after upgrades so tunnel and forwarding runtime state can recover without manually toggling entries.
- Fixed latency chart scaling so low-latency data no longer gets forced into an oversized 120ms range.
- Unified dashboard page spacing and tab/type control spacing across management pages.

### Changed

- Renamed system setting labels from system information to system configuration and changed one-click install wording to installation instructions.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.30. Agent version remains 2.2.51.

## [2.3.29] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added card/table view switching for tunnel management, forwarding rules, and forwarding groups.

### Fixed

- Fixed settings save buttons flashing through a temporary saving label by keeping button text stable and showing saved status via toast messages.

- Improved billing and traffic-billing stat card alignment to match the user management layout.
- Fixed Agent upgrade asset checks to verify Agent binaries from the panel release tag where they are actually published.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.29 and Agent target version to 2.2.51.

### Added

- Added browser-local persistence for the host management card/list view mode.
- Added Agent Token bound-host display and now use the Agent Token remark as the default name for newly registered hosts.
- Added a repository fallback release keystore so GitHub Actions can build signed Android release APKs when private signing secrets are not configured.

### Changed

- Reworked the add forwarding rule route selector into a compact segmented control for port forwarding, tunnel forwarding, and forwarding groups.
- Changed automatic panel update checks to only run on backend visits or browser refreshes, with a 1-minute cache interval.
- Changed the sidebar upgrade flow so confirming an upgrade starts it in the background, keeps progress visible in the lower-left area, and refreshes the browser after the upgraded panel comes back.
- Updated web introduction wording to "ForwardX转发管理面板".
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.11. Agent version remains 2.2.49.

## [2.3.07] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

### Fixed

- Split panel and Agent version sources so Agent release binaries no longer inherit the panel tag or package version.
- Treat previously misbuilt panel-versioned Agent reports such as 2.2.63/2.2.64 as outdated so they can be upgraded back to the correct Agent version line.
