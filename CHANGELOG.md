# Changelog

## [2.3.163] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Cleared stale tunnel runtime readiness caches when Agents reconnect, host runtime settings change, DNS updates are reported, or tunnel endpoints are refreshed so custom ForwardX tunnels are reapplied after Agent upgrades without requiring a manual toggle.
- Included load-balance tunnel exit nodes when waking affected Agents for runtime refreshes.
- Refined host edit date inputs, traffic quota display, and host-card realtime traffic labels.

### Changed

- Added a host traffic exhaustion reminder hint clarifying that alerts are sent through the TG bot.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.163. Agent target version remains 2.2.102.
- Android APP version remains 2.3.48 and the APK release pointer is updated to 2.3.163.

## [2.3.162] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added host-level DDNS controls so a host can update IPv4 or IPv6 records through the configured system DDNS provider when the Agent-reported address changes.
- Added panel-hosted ForwardX runtime and GOST release assets as a fallback path for Agent install and upgrade when GitHub assets are unavailable.

### Fixed

- Reworked Agent install and upgrade downloads to use connection timeout plus low-speed timeout instead of a fixed total download timeout, preventing slow active downloads from being interrupted.
- Applied the same low-speed timeout handling to GOST and realm runtime asset downloads and copied install commands.

### Changed

- Host cards now show traffic quota usage in the resource section and avoid duplicating the old inbound/outbound total cards.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.162 and Agent target version to 2.2.102.
- Android APP version remains 2.3.48 and the APK release pointer is updated to 2.3.162.

## [2.3.161] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Fixed GOST tunnel business routing so the primary and load-balance exits use the configured tunnel exit listener ports for the primary active rule instead of unexpected rule-allocated ports.
- Avoided generating duplicate GOST probe listeners on tunnel exit ports that are already used by active business tunnel rules.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.161. Agent target version remains 2.2.101.
- Android APP version remains 2.3.48 and the APK release pointer is updated to 2.3.161.

## [2.3.160] - 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Reworked Agent install script runtime checks so existing /usr/local/bin/forwardx-runtime is reused only when the bundled GOST runtime version matches; otherwise GOST is reinstalled and install/upgrade stops on runtime failure.
- Fixed load-balanced GOST/ForwardX tunnel TCPing history by storing each exit as its own latency series plus an aggregate maximum-latency series.
- Fixed tunnel latency charts so load-balanced tunnels show primary and extra exits with distinct colors and per-exit timeout states.

### Changed

- Agent now preserves tunnel probe series metadata in TCPing reports and sends all current tunnel probes together so multi-exit history is not split across cycles.
- Bumped panel version to 2.3.160 and Agent target version to 2.2.101.
- Bumped Android APP version to 2.3.48 and updated the APK release pointer to 2.3.160.

## [2.3.67] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Allowed existing multi-hop tunnels to switch between GOST and ForwardX custom-encryption runtimes during edit, with all hop Agents refreshed so the new runtime is applied.
- Added Agent-side tunnel port runtime state and stale FXP cleanup so switching a multi-hop tunnel between GOST and ForwardX clears the old listener before applying the new one.
- Stopped requiring or starting `gost` for the managed tunnel service when a host has no active GOST tunnel services, so plain iptables/nftables forwarding does not start GOST.
- Improved the multi-hop tunnel editor on mobile/app screens so hop rows wrap cleanly and the edit dialog remains scrollable on small viewports.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.67 and Agent target version to 2.2.63.

## [2.3.66] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Forced the Agent to clear stale local runtime before applying a rule when the same port switches to another forwarding type, including old managed services, iptables NAT rules, nftables rules, and traffic baselines.
- Removed connection/IP limit enforcement from direct port forwarding apply paths while keeping the cleanup in place for stale limit chains; tunnel forwarding still keeps those user access controls.
- Split socat apply commands into startup prerequisites and non-critical post-start traffic/accounting commands so a working socat service is no longer reported as not running just because counter setup fails.
- Switched iptables traffic accounting to direct mangle counter rules so reverse tests such as `iperf3 -R` avoid the old per-packet jump through `FWX_IN/FWX_OUT` chains.
- Moved nftables traffic accounting to dedicated mangle-priority direct counters so client upload traffic, such as `iperf3 -c <host> -p <port>`, is counted continuously as inbound traffic on the forwarding host without an extra per-packet jump through per-rule counter chains.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.66 and Agent target version to 2.2.62.

## [2.3.65] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Kept forwarding rule self-test dialogs in the testing state until the newly queued test result is returned, preventing stale previous results from restoring the button too early or leaving the UI stuck.
- Kept tunnel self-test dialogs in the testing state until the server reports the new pending/completed result, so the visible status matches the active test run.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.65. Agent target version remains 2.2.61.

## [2.3.64] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Added panel logs for direct forwarding rule self-test queue, result, and timeout events so stuck tests show their rule, host, and reason.
- Normalized Agent action `statusType` values before dispatch so plain rule actions no longer log an empty status type.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.64. Agent target version remains 2.2.61.

## [2.3.63] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.63. Agent target version remains 2.2.61.

## [2.3.62] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Restored GOST relay `nodelay` metadata to a boolean value and ensured middle-hop relay services stay in proxy mode without a fixed forwarder.
- Added GOST config summary and restart diagnostics to Agent command output for tunnel troubleshooting.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.62. Agent target version remains 2.2.61.

## [2.3.61] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Removed the leftover GOST multi-hop relay forwarder that sent middle-hop traffic to the generic tunnel probe port instead of allowing the entry chain to reach the rule-specific exit port.
- Made GOST relay metadata and exit target forwarding more explicit for better compatibility and diagnostics.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.61. Agent target version remains 2.2.61.

## [2.3.60] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Reverted GOST multi-hop business routing to use the existing hop listener ports instead of new rule-specific relay ports that may be blocked by host firewalls.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.60 and Agent target version to 2.2.61.

## [2.3.59] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Routed GOST multi-hop business traffic through per-rule relay ports so middle hops forward to the correct rule-specific exit port instead of the generic tunnel probe port.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.59. Agent target version remains 2.2.60.

## [2.3.58] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.58. Agent target version remains 2.2.60.

## [2.3.57] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed Agent tunnel actions with `rule=0` overwriting per-port rule traffic state on GOST multi-hop relay ports.
- Enabled `nodelay` on GOST relay connectors so multi-hop tunnel connections do not stall while waiting for client request data.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.57 and Agent target version to 2.2.60.

## [2.3.56] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Added non-billing GOST multi-hop relay traffic sampling so middle hop Agents report `[TunnelTraffic]` diagnostics for active tunnel rules.
- Kept GOST tunnel traffic billing on the exit host only to avoid double-counting usage across multi-hop relays.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.56. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.55] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.55. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.54] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Refreshed every host in a multi-hop tunnel when forwarding rules are created, updated, toggled, deleted, or self-tested so middle relay Agents receive the current topology.
- Treated stale successful removal reports for already-deleted rules as idempotent instead of returning `rule not found`.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.54. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.53] - 2026-05-30

- Fixed multi-hop tunnel runtime status so the tunnel is marked running only after every hop host reports a successful apply.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.51. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.50] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.50. Agent target version remains 2.2.59.

## [2.3.49] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Added Agent runtime handoff and bind-owner logs to diagnose GOST/ForwardX tunnel switching on reused entry ports.
- Fixed panel one-click upgrades when the latest version is detected from `main` before a matching release tag exists.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.47 and Agent target version to 2.2.59.

## [2.3.46] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed switching a multi-hop tunnel from GOST to ForwardX so old GOST tunnel services are stopped before FXP binds the same tunnel ports.
- Fixed Agent FXP startup reporting so immediate runtime exits, such as port bind failures, are reported as failed instead of `ok=true`.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.46 and Agent target version to 2.2.58.

## [2.3.45] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added one-click batch Agent upgrade from host management.
- Added optional Agent key-log upload with per-host and aggregate viewing in the logs page.

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic tunnel latency collection for multi-hop tunnels to aggregate fresh per-hop TCPing results instead of storing only the entry-to-next-hop latency.
- Fixed forwarding rule TCPing stats for tunnel rules to store tunnel latency plus exit-to-target latency, matching the manual self-test path.
- Reset and refresh old and new multi-hop hosts when tunnel hop topology changes so existing forwarding rules resync cleanly.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.45 and Agent target version to 2.2.57.

## [2.3.44] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed GOST multi-hop forwarding rules so the entry rule chain dials the configured middle hops directly and lands on the rule-specific tunnel exit port.
- Fixed tunnel forwarding rule self-tests to report estimated full-path latency from tunnel-hop latency plus exit-to-target latency, instead of only TCPing the entry listener.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.44 and Agent target version to 2.2.56 so GitHub Release assets can be used for machine updates.

## [2.3.43] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed GOST multi-hop tunnel rules so entry chains traverse every configured hop and land on the rule-specific tunnel exit port instead of the tunnel probe port.
- Fixed tunnel forwarding rule self-tests to prefer entry-port end-to-end probing instead of estimating latency from exit-to-target checks plus tunnel hop probes.
- Limited multi-hop tunnels to a maximum of five hosts from both the UI and server validation.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.43. Agent target version remains 2.2.55.

## [2.3.42] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed ForwardX multi-hop tunnels so rule traffic enters the configured hop chain instead of bypassing relay nodes.
- Fixed FXP relay downstream encryption handshakes to use the relay segment key, restoring data forwarding through multi-hop relay chains.
- Allowed intermediate tunnel hop Agents to report tunnel runtime status.

### Changed

- Bumped panel version to 2.3.42 and Agent target version to 2.2.55.

## [2.3.32] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Target addresses now support domain names in addition to IP addresses. The heartbeat handler resolves domains to IPs on each cycle and automatically re-applies forwarding rules when the resolved IP changes, ensuring forwarding stays online through DNS migrations.
- Forwarding rules that use user-space proxies (realm, socat, gost) now show an amber notice in the UI that connection and IP counts are conntrack-based approximations.

### Fixed

- Fixed Go Agent connection count reporting that was storing absolute conntrack snapshot values instead of deltas, causing massively inflated connection totals in the dashboard.
- Fixed counting chain traffic undercount in the shell-based Agent by removing it entirely and requiring the Go Agent binary for all installations. The Go Agent reads all five mangle hook points and takes the maximum to avoid double-counting.
- Cleaned up stale filter-table cleanup commands in the server-side counting chain removal logic.

### Changed
